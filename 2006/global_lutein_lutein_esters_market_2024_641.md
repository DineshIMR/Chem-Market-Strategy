<h1>Global Lutein and Lutein Esters Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>lutein and lutein esters market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 175.39 million in 2023 to USD 251.63 million by 2029</strong>, exhibiting a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.20% during 2024-2029</strong>, according to comprehensive market analysis. This growth trajectory reflects increasing consumer awareness about eye health and the expanding applications of lutein across nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and food industries.</p><p>Luteinâa xanthophyll carotenoid naturally found in leafy greens and marigold flowersâhas gained prominence as a <strong>powerful antioxidant</strong> supporting ocular health and cognitive function. Its esterified form offers enhanced stability, making it particularly valuable for dietary supplementation and functional food applications.</p><p><strong>1. Rising Prevalence of Age-Related Eye Disorders:</strong><br>
With global cases of macular degeneration projected to reach <strong>288 million by 2040</strong>, lutein demand is surging as clinical trials demonstrate <strong>25-30% risk reduction</strong> in age-related vision deterioration when consuming adequate lutein levels. This has driven 42% of eye health supplements to include lutein formulations since 2022.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
