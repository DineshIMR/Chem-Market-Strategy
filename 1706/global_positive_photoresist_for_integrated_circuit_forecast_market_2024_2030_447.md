<h1>Positive Photoresist for Integrated Circuit Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The global <strong>Positive Photoresist for Integrated Circuit market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>US$ 321.4 million in 2023 to US$ 438.8 million by 2030</strong>, registering a steady <strong>CAGR of 4.6% during 2024-2030</strong>, according to latest market analysis. This sustained demand stems from the semiconductor industry's relentless push toward <strong>advanced node technologies and wafer-level packaging innovations</strong> across consumer electronics, automotive, and IoT applications.</p><p>Positive photoresistsâlight-sensitive polymeric materials that become soluble upon exposure to specific wavelengthsâhave become <strong>mission-critical enablers for IC fabrication</strong>. Their precise pattern transfer capabilities and superior resolution make them indispensable for <strong>cutting-edge lithography processes below 10nm nodes</strong>, particularly in EUV and multi-patterning applications.</p><p><strong>1. Semiconductor Miniaturization Race:</strong><br>
The unrelenting drive toward <strong>5nm and 3nm process nodes</strong> has intensified demand for advanced photoresists with <strong>sub-20nm resolution capabilities</strong>. Leading foundries now allocate over <strong>35% of R&amp;D budgets</strong> to lithography material innovations, with EUV photoresists capturing <strong>72% of advanced node material investments</strong> in 2023.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

Advanced packaging solutions like <strong>2.5D/3D IC and fan-out wafer-level packaging (FOWLP)</strong> require specialized photoresists capable of handling <strong>high-aspect-ratio etching and multi-layer alignment</strong>. The sector is growing at <strong>7.2% CAGR</strong>, driven by heterogeneous integration demands in AI/ML chips.</p><p><strong>3. Regional Capacity Expansions:</strong><br>
While <strong>Taiwan, South Korea and the U.S.</strong> dominate leading-edge production, <strong>China's semiconductor self-sufficiency push</strong> has triggered <strong>28 new photoresist production facilities</strong> since 2021. Domestic players now account for <strong>19% of mainland China's photoresist supply</strong>, up from just 6% in 2018.</p><p>The sector faces several technical and geopolitical complexities:</p><p><strong>Material Engineering Bottlenecks:</strong> Developing photoresists for <strong>High-NA EUV systems</strong> requires unprecedented chemical precision, with formulation cycles now stretching to <strong>18-24 months</strong>âtriple the timeline for mature node materials.</p><p><strong>Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:</strong> The <strong>Japan-dominated photoresist supply chain</strong> (controlling 87% of advanced materials) creates strategic dependencies, with trade restrictions potentially delaying <strong>12-18 months of production capacity expansions</strong>.</p><p><strong>Talent Shortages:</strong> The field requires <strong>highly specialized polymer chemists</strong>, with the global talent pool meeting less than <strong>45% of industry demand</strong>, according to semiconductor workforce analyses.</p><p><strong>1. Next-Gen Lithography Materials:</strong><br>
The transition to <strong>High-NA EUV and directed self-assembly (DSA) lithography</strong> is creating robust demand for novel photoresist platforms. These next-gen formulations must achieve <strong>single-digit nanometer resolution</strong> while maintaining etch selectivity and line-edge roughness below <strong>1.2nm</strong>.</p><p><strong>2. Domestic Supply Chain Initiatives:</strong><br>
Multiple governments are incentivizing localized photoresist production through <strong>tax credits covering 25-30% of CAPEX</strong> and R&amp;D grants. This is fueling <strong>technology transfer partnerships</strong> between established suppliers and regional newcomers.</p><p><strong>3. Sustainable Formulations:</strong><br>
With semiconductor fabs targeting <strong>50% reduction in hazardous chemical usage</strong> by 2030, manufacturers are developing <strong>low-PFAS and reduced-solvent photoresists</strong> that maintain performance while meeting stringent environmental regulations.</p><p><strong>Multi-Wavelength Solutions:</strong> Hybrid photoresists combining <strong>EUV (13.5nm), DUV (193nm), and i-line (365nm)</strong> sensitivity are gaining traction for cost-effective multi-patterning schemes in mature nodes.</p><p><strong>Computational Material Design:</strong> AI-driven molecular modeling now accelerates photoresist development by <strong>40-60%</strong>, enabling rapid iteration of photoacid generators (PAGs) and resin systems.</p><p><strong>Packaging-Centric Formulas:</strong> Specialty photoresists for <strong>through-silicon vias (TSVs) and redistribution layers (RDLs)</strong> are incorporating stress-relief additives to prevent <strong>wafer warpage during 3D stacking</strong>.</p><p>The market remains <strong>highly concentrated</strong>, with <strong>Tokyo Ohka Kogyo (TOK), JSR, and Shin-Etsu controlling 78% of advanced photoresist supply</strong>. However, strategic shifts are underway:</p><p>Established players are investing heavily in <strong>EUV-ready manufacturing facilities</strong>, with TOK committing <strong>US$ 450 million</strong> to expand its EUV photoresist capacity by 2025. Meanwhile, Chinese contenders like <strong>Rongda Photosensitive Technology</strong> are making inroads in mature nodes through <strong>localized supply agreements</strong> with domestic foundries.</p><p><strong>By Product Type:</strong></p><p><strong>By Application:</strong></p><p><strong>By End User:</strong></p><p>This release summarizes findings from the comprehensive market study "<em>Positive Photoresist for Integrated Circuit Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</em>."
