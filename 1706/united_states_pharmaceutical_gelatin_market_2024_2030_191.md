<h1>United States Pharmaceutical Gelatin Market Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The United States <strong>pharmaceutical gelatin market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>$567.8 million in 2024 to $786.4 million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 5.6%</strong>, according to new market analysis. This growth stems from gelatin's indispensable role in drug encapsulation â serving as the backbone for approximately <strong>75% of all pharmaceutical capsule production</strong> in the country.</p><p>Derived primarily from <strong>bovine hides, porcine skins, and bones</strong>, pharmaceutical-grade gelatin undergoes meticulous purification to meet USP/EP standards. Its unique thermo-reversible gelling properties make it invaluable for <strong>hard and soft capsules, tablet coatings, and advanced drug delivery systems</strong>, particularly for sensitive biologics and controlled-release formulations.</p><p><strong>1. Capsule Manufacturing Boom:</strong><br>
The shift toward patient-friendly dosage forms has catapulted gelatin demand, with <strong>62% of new oral solid drugs</strong> in 2023 opting for capsule delivery. Gelatin's compatibility with hot-melt extrusion technology allows precise API loading up to <strong>80% drug payload</strong> â a key advantage over synthetic alternatives.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
